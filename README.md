# Neighborhood-Maps-App

This project is a single page application featuring a map of my neighborhood. I learned an immense amount about React and improved my understanding of ES6 Javascript. My favorite thing about React (currently) is that through components you can create extremely organized code. 

## Getting Started

This project was created using ```create-react-app```. Please run the project in production mode to ensure the service worker works properly!

## Prerequisite Information

 This project makes use of both Google Maps & Foursquare API's. In order to do this effectively I have integrated these two libraries:
 
 React Foursquare Library:
 
 ```
 https://github.com/foursquare/react-foursquare/blob/master/README.md
 ```
Google Maps Fetch Library:

```
https://www.npmjs.com/package/fetch-google-maps
```

## Installing

1. Clone repo

2. CD into project folder

3. Install React Foursquare Library

```run npm install -i react-foursquare```

4. Install Google Maps Fetch Library

## Service Worker
